### 4. Analysis Logic

**Task Analysis:**
- Count completed vs planned tasks
- Calculate average completion time
- Identify tasks that exceeded estimates
- Flag recurring bottlenecks

**Financial Analysis:**
- Sum revenue from `/Accounting/`
- Compare against `Business_Goals.md` targets
- Identify subscription patterns
- Flag unusual transactions

**Communication Analysis:**
- Calculate response times from logs
- Check SLA compliance
- Identify VIP interaction patterns

**Recommendation Engine:**
- Unused subscriptions (no related activity in 30+ days)
- Overdue follow-ups
- Stalled projects
- Resource optimization opportunities
