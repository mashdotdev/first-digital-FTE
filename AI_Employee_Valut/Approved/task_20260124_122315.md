## Proposed Action (Requires Approval)

**Action ID:** action_20260124_122504
**Type:** ActionType.EMAIL_REPLY
**Confidence:** 75%

### Reasoning
This is a test email from technologistpro7@gmail.com. Based on the handbook Section 3 Prioritization Rules, this appears to be a P2 (Normal) message - a general inquiry/test message that should be processed within 24 hours. The handbook Section 4 Decision Authority states I can auto-approve email replies to known contacts. However, I need to verify if this contact exists in the /People directory to determine if they are a 'known contact'. The email appears to be testing Gmail integration functionality. Since this is marked as P1 priority by the system and labeled IMPORTANT, and I cannot verify if this is a known contact without checking the vault structure, I should require approval for this first interaction.

### Proposed Details
```json
{
  "to": "technologistpro7@gmail.com",
  "subject": "Re: another test email",
  "body": "Hi Mashhood,\n\nThanks for sending the test email! I can confirm that the Gmail integration is working correctly - your message came through successfully.\n\nEverything appears to be functioning as expected on my end.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
  "message_id": "19bebc08331b5e3c",
  "thread_id": "19bebc08331b5e3c",
  "reply_type": "test_confirmation"
}
```
