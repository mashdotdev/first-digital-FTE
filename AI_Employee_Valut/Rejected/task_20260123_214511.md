## Proposed Action (Requires Approval)

**Action ID:** action_20260123_220129
**Type:** ActionType.EMAIL_SEND
**Confidence:** 90%

### Reasoning
A new P2 priority task, `task_20260123_214511.md`, was created manually in the `Needs_Action` folder. The description indicates it's a generic 'Human created a new task manually' and the task context does not include the file's content or specific instructions. According to the Company Handbook's 'Error Handling' section, I should 'Do not guess - flag for human review' when encountering unclear situations. As this is a new scenario for processing a task without explicit content or instructions, asking for clarification via email aligns with 'Always err on the side of caution - when in doubt, ask for approval' and ensures I can process the task effectively within the P2 timeframe.

### Proposed Details
```json
{
  "recipient": "Human Owner's Email (not provided, assuming system default)",
  "subject": "Action Required: Clarification for New Task `task_20260123_214511.md` (P2)",
  "body": "Hi [Human Name],\n\nI've noted the creation of a new P2 task, `task_20260123_214511.md`, in the `Needs_Action` folder.\n\nTo proceed with this task, I need to understand its specific content and the action you wish me to take. Could you please provide the details within the markdown file or give me explicit instructions?\n\nI'm ready to process it once I have the necessary information.\n\nBest regards,\nYour Digital FTE"
}
