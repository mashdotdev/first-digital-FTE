## Proposed Action (Requires Approval)

**Action ID:** action_20260123_221659
**Type:** ActionType.CUSTOM
**Confidence:** 95%

### Reasoning
A new task file (`task_20260123_214751.md`) has been created in the `Needs_Action` folder. As per the Company Handbook's 'Error Handling' section (principle 3), when encountering unclear situations, I must not guess and should flag for human review. The current input notifies me of the file's existence but does not provide its specific contents or instructions. Therefore, the appropriate first step is to acknowledge the task and request its detailed content to proceed with processing.

### Proposed Details
```json
{
  "task_id": "task_20260123_214751",
  "filename": "task_20260123_214751.md",
  "path": "..\\AI_Employee_Valut\\Needs_Action\\task_20260123_214751.md",
  "requested_action": "Please provide the detailed content of this task file so I can process it according to its instructions."
}
```

### Handbook References
- Error Handling: 3. Do not guess - flag for human review
- Mission Statement: ensuring nothing falls through the cracks - while always keeping me in control of important decisions.
